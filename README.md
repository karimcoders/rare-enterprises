# Rare Enterprises — Indigo & Gold Corporate Gifting

Live website: https://karimcoders.github.io/rare-enterprises/

A single-page corporate gifting landing website, using the client-supplied RE emblem with Rare Enterprises branding. The layout follows the marketing-page composition of the supplied CorporateGift reference, without a live ecommerce checkout, blog or user accounts. Collection tiles are enquiry links, not purchase flows.

## Current design
- White base, deep indigo `#39317d`, warm gold `#a77a27`, pale indigo `#f0eef8`, and champagne `#faf5e9`.
- Client-provided logo in the header, footer and favicon. Background removed without redrawing the mark.
- Oversized bold indigo/gold hero typography, six-feature grid and two alternating image/accordion sections.
- Newly AI-generated gifting photography, not imagery copied from the reference website.
- Two-card desktop / one-card mobile review carousel with arrows, dots, keyboard and touch controls.
- Clearly labelled illustrative reviews and generated reviewer portraits, not verified endorsements.
- One enquiry form and a compact footer.
- Responsive layout checked from 320px to 1440px.

## Run locally
Python 3.10+ is sufficient; no third-party Python libraries are required.

```sh
python server.py
```

Open http://localhost:3000. `index.html` is self-contained: fonts, images, CSS and JavaScript are embedded. The separately included `assets/brand-logo.png` and `assets/favicon.png` are editable branding source assets.

## GitHub Pages and form hosting
GitHub Pages publishes the static website from the root of the `main` branch.

**The form backend is temporary and separate from GitHub Pages.** It currently uses:
`https://shake-tries-fails-nearly.trycloudflare.com/api/enquiry`

The backend permits the GitHub Pages origin `https://karimcoders.github.io`. If the temporary backend or tunnel stops, the website still displays on GitHub Pages, but submitting the form will report that the service is unavailable. Email notifications are not connected.

Before production use, deploy `server.py` to persistent hosting, update the API URL in `index.html`, confirm the CORS origin, and connect an email or CRM destination if needed.

## Privacy and security
Enquiries are stored in `landing-private/enquiries.sqlite3` and `landing-private/enquiries.csv` on the backend host. Those files are excluded from Git and are not served by the web application. No enquiry records, passwords or GitHub tokens are present in this repository.

Replace illustrative reviews with approved customer testimonials before commercial use. The client-supplied logo remains the property of its owner. `robots.txt` currently discourages indexing of the prototype; update it when the production site is ready.

## Newly added reference sections
- Exact requested “Designed for frequent gifters” heading and platform copy, with hover-shadow cards. These are displayed as capability previews, not proof that those platform modules are implemented. Confirm actual business service scope before removing the visible availability note.
- “Shop our Most Popular Collections”: original generated photographs in a six-tile tall/square/wide mosaic. Tapping a tile preselects an occasion and includes the collection in the enquiry. No cart or checkout is added.
- “Our latest awards”: five visibly labelled placeholder badge slots. No G2 or other awards are claimed by Rare Enterprises. Replace these only with verified awards.

## Client domain
The client supplied `rareenterprisessolution.com`. At the time of this update it returned a Hostinger parked-domain page. This repository update does not change its DNS or hosting, and no custom-domain mapping has been configured. The repository and GitHub Pages project URL have been renamed to `rare-enterprises` at the client’s request. Use the new URL; old GitHub Pages links may no longer resolve.

## Bold typography update
Hero text is now 102px / weight 700 on large desktop viewports. Main section headings use a 58–70px bold scale, feature titles 24–26px, and reading text 15–18px. Responsive overrides keep the layout within the viewport down to 320px. Branding, sections, imagery, cards and enquiry flow are unchanged.

## Motion and interaction update
- Continuous, seamless occasion marquee with pause/play, pause-on-hover and keyboard-focus pause.
- One-time staggered scroll reveals, a subtle page-progress line and active section navigation.
- Improved card and button hover effects plus a short hero entrance.
- Reviews rotate every 6.5 seconds only while visible, and pause on interaction or a hidden browser tab. A dedicated control pauses automatic rotation.
- Reduced-motion preferences disable nonessential animation and review autoplay.

## Logo-palette and category-strip update
- All visible interface text now uses the RE logo’s indigo/gold palette, related accessible tones, or white contrast text. Black/charcoal text was removed from headings, body copy, forms and SVG badge labels.
- Feature icons and badge placeholders now follow the same palette. Photography is unchanged.
- A clean, reference-inspired row below the hero presents six gifting categories with original line icons: Employee Onboarding, Festive Gifting, Client Appreciation, Team Milestones, Branded Merchandise, and Events & Celebrations. These are category links, not client logos or endorsements.
- Each category links to the enquiry form and prefills the occasion and interest; no checkout.
- Indigo/gold decorative hero shapes, white space and bold type retained alongside the existing marquee and controlled animations.
- Responsive layout verified at 14 widths from 320px to 1440px.

## Latest client revision: contact buttons and typography
This revision supersedes the earlier no-black-paragraph direction: **all paragraph copy is now black**, while headings, icons and controls retain the RE indigo/gold theme.
- Hero eyebrow: “Gift for better connection”.
- Header and hero primary CTAs: “Start gifting”, both targeting the enquiry form.
- Hero heading line-height reduced to 0.92 on desktop and 0.94 on smaller screens, with reduced space above.
- Accessible floating WhatsApp and call buttons, configured for the client-provided number **+91 84669 81603**. WhatsApp opens a prefilled enquiry in a new tab; telephone link uses `tel:+918466981603`. Opening WhatsApp does not send a message automatically.
- Brand-coloured controls, hover/focus labels, reduced-motion support and 48px minimum mobile touch targets.
- Existing gifting-category strip, collections, marquee, review carousel and enquiry flow preserved.

## Current hero and brand update
- Header/footer wordmark: **RARE ENTERPRISES**, with **Rare Enterprises Solution** directly below, left-aligned with the wordmark beside the RE emblem.
- Hero eyebrow: **GIFT BETTER CONNECTIONS.**
- Fixed headline: **We make / every gift / Memorable.** (spelling corrected).
- Main header/hero CTA: **GIFT HERE**. All text CTA buttons display uppercase; descriptive actions retain meaningful labels.
- Right-hand hero: five image-only slides, comprising the original hamper and four newly generated indigo/gold gift photographs (technology, festive, executive desk and employee welcome kits). No extra image captions or rotating hero copy.
- Three-second autoplay, previous/next controls, five selectors, pause/play, keyboard arrows and swipe; autoplay pauses on hover/focus, hidden browser tab or when the gallery is offscreen. Reduced-motion preferences disable autoplay/fades.
- Black paragraphs, enquiry links, WhatsApp/call number and the other page sections are unchanged.

## Latest interaction polish
- WhatsApp button now uses recognizable brand green `#25D366` with the white WhatsApp mark (vector from Simple Icons: https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/icons/whatsapp.svg). Contact number remains +91 84669 81603.
- Gift icons added to 23 gifting-related CTAs, including header/hero GIFT HERE, collection/exploration links and enquiry submission. CTA labels remain uppercase. Navigation arrows and privacy acknowledgement controls retain their own appropriate symbols.
- Five-image hero carousel now advances every **3 seconds**, verified by measuring a 3000 ms interval in the browser. Existing pause, manual controls, hover/focus/visibility safeguards and reduced-motion support remain.
